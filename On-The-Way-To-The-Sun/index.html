                        absent-minded boy named Jeffrey. He attends the local high school where he takes all types
                        of courses like math and biology, but there is one class in particular that he has a hard time
                        understanding every time he takes it, Science class.

                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The problem he has with the class is that everything seems
                            absurdly complicated
                            and he doesn't see the point in studying all of it. Jeffrey's teacher has been aware of his
                            peculiar
                            student and as an alternative solution suggested a field trip to the famous research center
                            called
                            Kennedy Space Center. All the students in the room jumped with excitement upon hearing the
                            news, except
                            Jeffrey who gave a huge sigh because he knew it was going to be a boring day.

                            expectations
                            that everyone had about the place. Jeffrey rather not to say much about it and slept on the
                            bus while it
                            reached its destination. After a few hours, Jeffrey heard a babble starting to form inside
                            the bus. The
                            noise was so loud that Jeffrey decided to open his eyes to investigate what was happening.
                            Pleasant was
                            his surprise when he saw the enormous installations that everyone could see from the glass
                            of the window.
                            All the students began to get off the bus and walk towards the main entrance where they
                            would be greeted.
                            Jeffrey seemed to be the most amazed of the whole group, he really couldn't believe that in
                            that enormous
                            building they are dedicated to working on the science that he ignores so much.

                            Matthew was surprised to hear this as he thought all the children were having a good time on
                            the tour. Matthew was about to answer the question, when suddenly a bell rang, indicating
                            the recess of the people who worked in the place. Matthew indicated that recess time was
                            going to start shortly, so he was going to give a couple of minutes so that everyone could
                            view the exhibition that most caught their attention. Most of the kids split up into small
                            groups while Jeffrey decided to go on his own in search of something that could answer his
                            question.

                            Jeffrey walked to one end of the room, but found nothing relevant enough to satisfy his
                            curiosity. Jeffrey was about to give up when he suddenly noticed an exhibit with a flat
                            screen TV and a small scale model of what appeared to be a ship. What most caught his
                            attention were the images that were being broadcast on the television, it was a spectacle of
                            reddish explosions that resembled a shower of fireworks.
